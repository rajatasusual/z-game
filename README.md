## Features

	•	Sliding Tiles: Merge tiles in any direction to build higher-value letters.
	•	Word Formation: Form valid words of 3-5 letters to score points.
	•	Multiplier Bonus: Stack up multiple words for a massive score multiplier!
	•	Scrabble Point System: Earn more points for high-value letters.
	•	Interactive Gameplay: Clickable tiles for added strategy.
	•	Dynamic Timer: Earn time based on the value of merged letters.

## Game Rules

	1.	Sliding Mechanics: Slide tiles in any direction to combine letters. When two tiles with the same letter collide, they merge to form the next letter in alphabetical order (e.g., A + A = B).
	2.	Form Words: Create valid 3-5 letter words by merging tiles. The game uses the Scrabble point system for scoring, so aim for high-value letters!
	3.	Time Boosts: Every time you combine letters, you earn time based on the Scrabble value of the resulting letter. This keeps the game going longer!
	4.	Tap to Clear Words: Once you’ve formed a word, tap on it to clear it from the board. Tiles above will fall to fill the space.
	5.	Penalties for Wrong Words: Be careful when tapping tiles! If you tap a sequence that doesn’t form a valid word, you’ll lose points.
	6.	Multipliers: Build multiple words before clearing to earn a multiplier bonus on your score. The more words you stack, the bigger the multiplier!
	7.	Active Gameplay: Keep moving! Skipping a turn without moving tiles deducts a point from your score.
